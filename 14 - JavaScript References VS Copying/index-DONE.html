    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let number = 100;
    let number2 = number;
    console.log(number, number2);

    number = 200;
    console.log(number, number2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // const team = players;
    // console.log('team', team)
    // console.log('players', players)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // console.log('team', team)
    // console.log('players', players)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    console.log('players', players) // original array is untouched
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log('team2', team2)
    console.log('players', players)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log('team3', team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log('team4', team4)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Four';
    console.log('team4', team4)
    console.log('players', players)

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Five';
    console.log('team5', team5)
    console.log('players', players)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const leute = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99});
    console.log('leute', leute);
    console.log('person', person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Poor man's deep clone
    // Might have performance issues
    JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
